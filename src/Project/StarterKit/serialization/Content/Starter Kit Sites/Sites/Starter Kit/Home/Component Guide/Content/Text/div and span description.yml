      Hint: Content
      Value: To allow content authors and front end designers to be able to easily skin a site, we have componentized the standard HTML div and span tags. These are just like normal html containers but can be easily configured with custom ID's, css classes and configured to show and hide on different device and screen sizes.<br><br>
