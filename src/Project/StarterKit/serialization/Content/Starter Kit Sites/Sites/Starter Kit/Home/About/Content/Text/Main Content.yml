        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Sitecore Foundation was primarily built as a side project by David San Filippo with several other contributors over the years. It has been used as a complete asset on several projects around the world and parts of the framework have been used in even more projects.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All development has moved to Github, hosted in Avanade's very own account.</p>
