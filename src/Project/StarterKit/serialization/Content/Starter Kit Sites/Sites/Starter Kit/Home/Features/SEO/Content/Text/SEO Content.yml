        <h1>SEO Features</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">To best support search engine optimization techniques in a Sitecore solution, we have implemented a number of features that can be easily be turned on or leveraged to ensure best practices are being followed and content authors are empowered to take ownership of tweaking settings themselves, instead of needing to rely on developers to manage these processes.</p><h2>Dynamic XML Sitemaps</h2><p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">Having an indexable xml sitemap for every site is a best practice. These sitemaps can be crawled by search engines to easily discover the content on the site and the frequency at which it changes. To support this need, we have built a custom dynamic xml sitemap generation tool and made it configurable both at the page level and the global site configuration level.</span></p><ul>
