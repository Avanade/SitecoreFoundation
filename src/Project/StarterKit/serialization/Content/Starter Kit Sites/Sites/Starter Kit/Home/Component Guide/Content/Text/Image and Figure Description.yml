      Hint: Content
      Value: Our component library offers two components that allow content authors to easily configure an image on a page. The image component produces simple markup for an image and caption. The figure component uses HTML5 semantic markup to accomplish the same thing. &nbsp;And since both components are compatible renderings, you can easily switch between the two.<br><br>
