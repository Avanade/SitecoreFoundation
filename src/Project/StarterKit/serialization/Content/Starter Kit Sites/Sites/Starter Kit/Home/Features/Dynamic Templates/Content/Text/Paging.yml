        <h2>Paging Support</h2>
        <p>To quickly support presenting a list of items of any template type, we created a Handlebar collection containers which allow you to define what items or folders to source items for and allows you to define a custom template to present each of the items. We even integrated a paging control that will allow visitors to go through the list of items with no custom development. See it in action below:</p>
