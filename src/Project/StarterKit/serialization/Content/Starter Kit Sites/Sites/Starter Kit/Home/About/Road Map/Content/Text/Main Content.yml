        <h1>Road Map</h1>
        <p>This is but the beginning. You can use the framework as is to start assembling sites and creating your own components to either use of specific client projects or contribute back to the framework. That being said, we see the need to continue building and offer additional features that would be useful. Here are some we are planning (though no dates or commitments are being made).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search - Supporting Lucene, Coveo and SOLR</li>
            <li>Login &amp; Registration Components</li>
            <li>Deployment Guidance&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Foundation Components - Equalizer, Split/Drop Down Buttons, Sticky Nav</li>
            <li>Code Text integration - Intellisense and Syntax highlighting for CSS and JS.</li>
            <li>Adaptive Images Integration - Optimize Images based on device size.</li>
        </ul>
