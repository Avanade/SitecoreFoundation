        <h2>Common Redirects</h2>
        <p>Besides handling 301 redirects, we have implemented a quick way to force urls to be secured using https and include www if desired. These settings can easily be toggled in the Site Configuration. For development purposes you can disable this functionality using custom Site Settings if desired.</p>
        <p><img height="158" alt="Redirection Settings" width="656" src="~/media/EE7CDC7144B24741B554CEDE968F1541.ashx?h=158&amp;w=656" style="height: 158px; width: 656px;"></p>
        <h2>IP White Listing</h2>
        <p>With IIS, you can enable white listing, but it applies to the entire site. This is not ideal when trying to support multi site scenarios where the client may want to restrict access to a site until it is approved to go live. To support this we have built a featured that can be enabled at the site level. It will union a set of global white listing rules with a set of site specific white listing rules. This allows you to configure a set of IP's which should always have access to all white listed sites as well as a set of site specific rules to enable just for that site. This feature supports both single IP's as well as IP Ranges.<br><br></p>
