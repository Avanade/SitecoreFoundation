        <p>A custom pipeline assembles and caches the resource. When either the site, the page or the resources themselves are published, the cache is cleared.</p>
        <h2>Header and Footer Injection</h2>
        <p>Typically there are requirements to add custom script or other tags either globally or the page level. This can be to support analytics or other third party tracking needs. To make this easier in a Sitecore project we have made fields available both in the Site configuration and page level.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><img height="296" alt="Site Scripts" width="657" src="~/media/636668C7FF8146ABBB07EEC6ED0C5CB9.ashx?h=296&amp;w=657" style="height: 296px; width: 657px;"></p>
        <p>Page Authors can easily modify the page specific header and footer settings directly from the page editor by clicking "Styles and Scripts" on the Properties Tab of the Experience Editor:</p>
        <p><img height="132" alt="Experience Editor Integration" width="691" src="~/media/70F90ADBF35A4B308CC1D194152BC559.ashx"></p>
        <h2>Layout Integration</h2>
        <p>Integrating support for Site and Page Resources or Header and Footer Injection is really easy. We provide HTML helpers that do all the heavy lifting. Here's the page layout for this site:</p>
        <p><img height="605" alt="Layout" width="815" src="~/media/750A81F76AD0456A9A8D573792DBD22E.ashx"></p>
        <p>GetHeaderStyles and GetFooterScripts do all the heavy lifting. This allows your layouts to remain relatively clean.</p>
        <h2>Azure CDN Integration</h2>
        <p>We have an optional configuration file which can be enabled to server all these resources from the Azure CDN. Since that CDN is not a lazy load CDN, we have implemented custom code to update the CDN everytime a resource, page or site is modified. It also will adjust links to resources to ensure that they are served from the CDN automatically.</p>
