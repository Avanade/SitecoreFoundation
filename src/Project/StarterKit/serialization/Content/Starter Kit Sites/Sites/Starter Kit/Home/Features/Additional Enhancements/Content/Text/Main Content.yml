        <h1>Additional Features</h1>
        <p>There are many more features implemented in this framework. Other useful features include:</p>
        <h2>Composite Components</h2>
        <p><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">This component type actually allows you to embed other components within it and reuse it completely on other pages. This gives you an additional layer of abstraction to drive personalization and A/B Testing too.</span></p>
        <h2><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">Handlebar Containers and Templates</span></h2>
        <p><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">Bind these flexible components to any Sitecore template and use Handlebar Syntax to create a customized view for that data. Even Has a built in collection component that will automatically support paging through your content. Check out the playground to see it in action.</span></p>
        <h2>Favicon Support</h2>
