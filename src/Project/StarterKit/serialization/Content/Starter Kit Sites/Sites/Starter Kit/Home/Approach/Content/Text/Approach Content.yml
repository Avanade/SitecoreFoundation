        <h1>Avanade's Sitecore Foundation</h1>
        <p>
        Instead of starting each Sitecore implementation from scratch, build on a proven foundation. The Sitecore Foundation framework is an opinionated component based architectural framework that provides a suite of front end UI components and robust set of backend services that make building Sitecore sites faster, easier and with higher quality. Instead of reinventing the wheel for every site, you could be:

        <ul>
            <li>Quickly configuring new sites and site collections using Branch Templates in a proven information architecture instead of defining custom structures that may not be as flexible. </li>
            <li> Assembling new pages using a robust component library instead of developing new layouts and renderings from scratch.</li>
            <li> Configuring common solutions like Meta Tags, Social Tags, Error Handling, Xml Sitemaps instead of building custom solutions.</li>
        </ul>

        Our library of over 50 components are fully responsive and built using the Zurb Foundation css framework. Checkout the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D4A030DC13274D728E29152585E07BB1&amp;_z=z">Component Guide</a> for details.

        <p>
        Need to bind to custom templates that represent a semantic entity like a product or news article? With dynamic templates, you can define custom presentation for items or lists of items using "Handlebar" syntax which are pre-compiled and executed server side.
        </p>
        <p>
        Still have a custom requirement that's not supported? Add your own components faster than building from scratch by leveraging our extensive library of extension methods and helpers.
