        "To make it easier to manage 301 redirection rules at the site level, we have implemented support for both direct match and regex driven 301 redirection rules. Rules can be configured in a special "Redirection Rules" folder located under the Site Configuration Item. Since the rules are related to the site's configuration, you can easily constrain a particular redirection rule to a specific site. This is more difficult to do with other approaches to managing 301 redirects.<br><br>We currently support two types of redirects: Direct Match and Pattern. The direct match rule performs an exact match against a url and allows you to specify an item to redirect to. Query string parameters are preserved.&nbsp;<br><br>Pattern rules leverage regular expressions to define the type of url to match as well as the destination. Pattern rules support two types of destination patterns: Sitecore Item and Http Url. If the pattern resolves to a Sitecore Item Path, the item's url will be determined to handle the redirect. With a pure http pattern, the destination url will be redirected directly. This can be useful if redirecting outside of the Sitecore site itself.<br><br>
