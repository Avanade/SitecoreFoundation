        <h2>Language Enforcement</h2>
        <p>Another common feature enhancement is to ensure 404 pages are returned if an item is requested in an unsupported language. Out of the box, Sitecore treats any two character path at the beginning of the url as a language and will attempt to resolve it even if the language isn't configured for the site or Sitecore instance. We implemented a feature that overrides this behavior and throws a 404 if an unsupported language is requested. Just define the valid languages in the "Site Configuration" and that's it.</p>
