*** Do not generate C# files in this project. These templates are for linking only. ****

Use these t4 Templates to create glass models. These templates extend the standard templates in two ways:

- Gives you properties for Template Name, Template Id and All the Field Id's of each property.
- Creates Generic View or Handlebar template as comments in the Model File. Can use to quickly scaffold components. Feel free to eactend.

Add these templates to your TDS projects as linked files, so you can make changes in one place:

From: https://www.teamdevelopmentforsitecore.com/Blog/share-t4-template-files-tds-projects

This works exactly the same as other linked file types in Visual Studio (Share code with Add as Link). 
The steps to add a linked template are the following:
Right-click on the Code Generation Templates folder in the solution explorer.
Choose “Add Existing Item”
Browse to the files in another TDS project
On the add dialog, there is a little down arrow next to the “Add” button. Click that and select “Add as link”
